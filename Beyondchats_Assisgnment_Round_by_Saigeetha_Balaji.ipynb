But I\\u2019d like to communicate with you more regularly and directly about what we\\u2019re thinking and building. Many of these ideas come from our conversations with mods and users who participate in programs like Mod Council, Partner Communities, and the User Feedback Collective.\\u00a0\\n\\nWe recently shared our [Q1 earnings results](https://www.reddit.com/r/RDDT/comments/1kcibvm/reddit_announces_q125_earnings_plus_ama/) (TL;DR: Solid quarter). Beyond the numbers, I wanted to highlight a few moments from the start of the year:\\n\\n* In March, we [released a set of tools](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/1j4z42x/making_contributing_easier_on_reddit_new_tools/), including post suggestions, insights, and rule checking, to help users participate successfully in conversations and let mods focus more on leading their communities. Reddit should feel easier to contribute to, especially for first-timers, and these are some of the ways we\\u2019re working towards that.\\n* [Reddit Answers](https://www.reddit.com/answers)\\u2014our AI-powered search tool\\u2014is live in nine countries, including the US, UK, and India with support in English and more countries and languages on the way. It\\u2019s being used for everything from \\u201cwhat\\u2019s the best espresso machine\\u201d to \\u201clast night\\u2019s episode of The Last of Us.\\u201d Still early, but the vision is simple: make Reddit\\u2019s seemingly infinite human knowledge easier to access. Most of the conversations on Reddit happen on posts less than a day old. Reddit Answers unlocks the other 20 years. Reddit Answers doesn\\u2019t replace conversations\\u2014it\\u2019s a quicker path towards them.\\n* In the first quarter, \\u201creddit\\u201d was the 6th most Googled word in the U.S. (and sandwiched between \\u201cnews\\u201d and \\u201ctrump,\\u201d which is, I think, Chaotic Neutral on the internet alignment chart), proving that 1) people want what Reddit has and 2) Reddit search isn\\u2019t there quite yet, but [we\\u2019re right on schedule](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/59k22p/comment/d992fwq/?context=1).\\u00a0\\n* 2.2 million players joined our April Fools\\u2019 Day event, [r/field](https://www.reddit.com/r/Field/) (with roughly half in my honor\\\\*), and it\\u2019s an early proof of what\\u2019s possible for [games on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/GamesOnReddit/). It\\u2019s really special to see people creating their own interactive experiences on our [Developer Platform](https://developers.reddit.com/), and I trust whatever our users come up with will be far more interesting than anything we build ourselves.\\n\\n[\\\\*Mentions of \\u201cfuck spez\\u201d on Reddit](https://preview.redd.it/84rkh6lyzyye1.png?width=1209&format=png&auto=webp&s=c6a2085fa65a9e807116fa75c9f507a4f621d44d)\\n\\nNext month, Reddit turns 20. Honestly, it blows my mind. A lot has changed on Reddit over the years, and a lot has stayed the same. The core of Reddit\\u2019s identity hasn\\u2019t changed much\\u2014our model is still based on communities, voting, and (mostly) anonymous users, so our conversations remain some of the most real you can find online.\\n\\nToday, we see Reddit as having two superpowers: community and knowledge. At the end of last year, we updated our mission statement to reflect both: **Empower communities, and make their knowledge accessible to everyone.** This captures both our longstanding work in creating a platform for community and for using Reddit as a source for knowledge.\\n\\nReddit is unlike any other platform, and that\\u2019s by design. While social media feeds you whatever content drives the most engagement, on Reddit, you decide what matters and make it popular through voting. We\\u2019re also one of the last major sites that doesn\\u2019t require you to sign in to access most features. We do this because we think it\\u2019s important, and we believe our open model helps fulfill the internet\\u2019s purpose: to bring individuals from all over the world together to discover, engage with, and exchange ideas that matter to them, without barriers and regardless of geography or language.\\n\\nAnd as we look ahead, we want to double down on these values. Our goal is to make Reddit the best version of itself by being faster, better, and easier to use. Here\\u2019s how we\\u2019re bringing that vision to life:\\n\\n**Core product improvements:** Across the platform, we\\u2019ll be trying out a range of updates to make things better. We\\u2019ll be making it easier to create and read posts and find new subreddits, upgrading profile pages, evolving r/popular, improving wikis, and ~~creating~~ fixing a lot of bugs. We will keep you updated with changes as we go.\\u00a0\\n\\n**Moderation:** Moderators make communities, and by definition, without moderators, there are no communities. Moderating subreddits today can be time-consuming, too manual, and at times frustrating. It can be difficult to recruit new mods, and growing a community from scratch is way too hard. Often, a few folks end up carrying the weight, which isn\\u2019t fair or sustainable. Our vision is to shift the primary role of a moderator from policing to community cultivation. We\\u2019ll get there with better tools\\u2014especially more AI-driven automation\\u2014that moderators can choose to use in their communities. Focus groups, early product testing, and feedback loops shape how these systems evolve. u/Go_JasonWaterfalls will share more with mods here soon. I want to sincerely thank the many mods who have joined our councils, groups, and feedback sessions over the last couple of years to help us in this journey.\\n\\n**Search:** We believe search being great on Reddit will make the whole product better. Increasingly, people come to Reddit with a specific question that likely has been answered a hundred different ways. And whether you\\u2019re a first-time visitor or an old.reddit diehard, search should help you get to where you\\u2019re going faster. I\\u2019m the first to admit, finding what you\\u2019re looking for on Reddit hasn\\u2019t always (ever) been easy. We\\u2019ve made a lot of progress in the last few years and have many more improvements coming this year, including expanding Reddit Answers and integrating it directly into the core search experience.\\u00a0\\n\\n**AI + Humans:** An increasing amount of the content you see online is generated by machines\\u2014so how does AI fit into the most human place on the internet? First, AI can be incredibly useful for things like summarization, safety, translation, and moderation. That includes filters that reduce the burden on mods by automatically removing spam, hateful, or violent content. And it powers things like [post guidance](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/17625458521748-Automations-Post-Comment-Guidance-Set-Up), which can tell a user whether their post violates a subreddit rule before they submit it\\u2014this helps new users learn the rules and also saves mods lots of time. Reddit\\u2019s strength is in its people, and we want AI tools that help you do what you\\u2019re already doing.\\n\\nThat said, unwelcome AI in communities is a serious concern. It is the worry I hear most often these days from users and mods alike. **Reddit works because it\\u2019s human**. It\\u2019s one of the few places online where real people share real opinions. That authenticity is what gives Reddit its value. If we lose trust in that, we lose what makes Reddit\\u2026Reddit. Our focus is, and always will be, on keeping Reddit a trusted place for human conversation.\\u00a0\\n\\nAt the same time, anonymity is essential to Reddit. People come here to share experiences they wouldn\\u2019t post anywhere else because they know they are safe to do so. To make this possible, historically, Reddit has required practically no information to create an account. We have been\\u2014and will continue to be\\u2014extremely protective of your personal information, and will continue to push back against excessive or unreasonable demands from public or private authorities. If you want to know more about how we respond to\\u00a0 legal requests from governments, law enforcement, and private parties, check out our biannual [Transparency Report](https://redditinc.com/policies/transparency-report-july-to-december-2024).\\n\\nTo keep Reddit human and to meet evolving regulatory requirements, we are going to need a little more information. Specifically, we will need to know whether you are a human, and in some locations, if you are an adult. But **we never** want to know your name or who you are. The way we will do this is by working with various third-party services that can provide us with the essential information and nothing else. No solution is perfect\\u2014including the status quo\\u2014but we will do our best to preserve both the humanness and anonymity of Reddit. We will share more as we go.\\n\\n**Premium content:** You might\\u2019ve seen some headlines about \\u201cpaid subreddits.\\u201d Perhaps those articles were behind paywalls. Let me clarify: we\\u2019re not putting Reddit behind a paywall. We are thinking about how to empower communities to monetize through premium experiences and exclusive spaces. One way to do that is by enabling communities to offer a separate space for their most leaned-in members (back in the day, the most loved feature of Reddit Gold was access to r/lounge, and we\\u2019d like to reimagine this). This would be an optional feature for communities that [want it](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSezA2xdhjMYEHkPRdIs4pVXyTB2vtqcPMZ4pQt679Yv1Ef05w/viewform).\\n\\n**Sunsetting old.reddit:** old.reddit is the version of Reddit that we built back in the mid-2000s. It doesn\\u2019t scale, it\\u2019s impossible to develop on, and it\\u2019s ugly af. We will be shutting it down at the end of the month.\\n\\nJust kidding. I don\\u2019t know why I say stuff like this. We\\u2019ll figure out how to work around it and keep it online as long as people are using it.\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/prh1c0ewzyye1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=3c1fac3e0438d234b04dc5ec2443e7e6962a988d\\n\\nThank you all for being a part of this. Reddit works because you contribute, upvote, downvote, moderate, and create spaces where real conversations happen. The internet is changing rapidly, and human perspectives have never been more important. More than ever, it\\u2019s essential that we share information, express our viewpoints, and find connection.\\u00a0\\n\\nThe last 20 years have proven how powerful online communities can be\\u2014and as we look ahead, I\\u2019m even more excited for what the next 20 will bring.\\n\\nThank you,\\n\\nSteve aka spez\",\n          \"Hey All,\\n\\nI just wanted to leave a quick note and say we\\u2019re listening to all the feedback around CSS / customization.
